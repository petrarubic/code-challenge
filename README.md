## Running the project

In order to run backend on port 3001, go to the **server** folder and run the following in the terminal:

- npm install
- npm start

In order to run frontend on port 3000, go to the **client** folder and run the following in the terminal:

- npm install
- npm start

## Testing the backend

In order to run tests, go to the **server** folder and run: npm test. I don't have any experience with writing tests in node.js, so I couldn't figure out why test are failing, but code can be seen in api.test.js within server folder.
